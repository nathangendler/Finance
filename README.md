# Finance: a simulated stock brokerage website

## My first experience with full-stack development

This was the first project where I explored the entire web development stackâ€”from building dynamic interfaces and secure authentication to managing a database and integrating with real-time financial APIs. Here are some of the key features of the project:
- Used flask, SQLite, and Jinja tempaltes to build a full-stack web app
- Implemented user registration, login/logout, and session management with hashed passwords
- Integrated real-time stock price data using a financial API to power stock lookup, buying, and selling
- Managed user portfolios and transaction history with persistent database storage
- Created a responsive dashboard displaying current holdings, live prices, and total account value
- Designed a clear transaction history log to track all buy/sell activity
